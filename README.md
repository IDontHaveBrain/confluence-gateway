**Enhanced Confluence Search and Knowledge Retrieval with RAG and LLMs**

Confluence Gateway aims to bridge the gap between your Confluence knowledge base and modern AI capabilities. It provides enhanced search functionalities, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integration, and Large Language Model (LLM) powered answers based on your Confluence documents.

## Overview

Many teams rely on Confluence as their central knowledge repository. However, finding the *right* information quickly can sometimes be challenging using standard search. Confluence Gateway enhances this experience by:

1.  **Indexing:** Processing and embedding Confluence pages.
2.  **Retrieval:** Using semantic search (RAG) to find the most relevant document chunks based on user queries.
3.  **Generation:** Leveraging LLMs to synthesize information from retrieved documents and provide direct, contextual answers.
4.  **Direct API Access:** Offering standard keyword search via the Confluence API.
5.  **MCP Server:** Providing specific MCP-related functionalities (Details TBD).

This project is designed for teams and developers looking to unlock deeper insights and improve information accessibility within their Confluence instances.

## Project Status

This project is currently in the **early stages of development (Alpha)**.
